Build a CRUD Serverless API from scratch using AWS Lambda (Python), API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
1. Introduction

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute solution that allows you to run code without the need for server provisioning or management. You only pay for the compute time you use. This indicates that my own project, which will not receive a lot of traffic, is a great choice for AWS Lambda. This use case is ideal for applications with variable traffic or that can scale to zero.

AWS CLI installed

AWS CLI
GIT
